# üîç LLM-Free AI Fact Checker using BART + FAISS + Keyword Matching

This project is a lightweight AI-powered fact-checking system that allows users to verify the truthfulness of short public statements (e.g., news or social media posts) by comparing them against a database of verified facts.

Real life use cases:- To check whether any news is fake or real especially during the pandemic,war situation to avoid mishaps this could be effectively used.

‚ö° Powered by:
-  BART for zero-shot classification
-  MiniLM embeddings for semantic similarity
-  FAISS for fast vector search
-  Streamlit for user interface

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **User enters a news statement** or uploads a `.txt` file.
2. The app extracts core claims/entities.
3. It retrieves top similar verified facts from a local database using vector embeddings.
4. Using either:
   - ü§ñ BART-based AI classification, or
   - üß© Simple keyword-based heuristics,
   it determines if the claim is ‚úÖ True, ‚ùå False, or üü° Unverifiable.
5. Shows verdict, matched evidence, and technical reasoning.
6. streamlit run app.py
