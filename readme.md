# 🔍 LLM-Free AI Fact Checker using BART + FAISS + Keyword Matching

This project is a lightweight AI-powered fact-checking system that allows users to verify the truthfulness of short public statements (e.g., news or social media posts) by comparing them against a database of verified facts.

Real life use cases:- To check whether any news is fake or real especially during the pandemic,war situation to avoid mishaps this could be effectively used.

⚡ Powered by:
- ✅ BART for zero-shot classification
- ✅ MiniLM embeddings for semantic similarity
- ✅ FAISS for fast vector search
- ✅ Streamlit for user interface

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User enters a news statement** or uploads a `.txt` file.
2. The app extracts core claims/entities.
3. It retrieves top similar verified facts from a local database using vector embeddings.
4. Using either:
   - 🤖 BART-based AI classification, or
   - 🧩 Simple keyword-based heuristics,
   it determines if the claim is ✅ True, ❌ False, or 🟡 Unverifiable.
5. Shows verdict, matched evidence, and technical reasoning.
